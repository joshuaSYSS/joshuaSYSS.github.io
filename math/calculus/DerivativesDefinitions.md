## Derivatives Definitions

### What is a derivative?
The derivative of y = f(x) is the slope of the line tangent to the graph y = f(x).\
But then, what is a tangent line?\
It is the line that is drawn such that it touches the graph (Intersects the graph at 1 point), and the slope of the tangent line is also the slope of the graph at that (intersecting) point.\
\
Imagine you first plot 2 points on the graph, P and Q, where P is the point where you want to evaluate the derivative.\
Now, keep moving Q closer to P, and keep calculating the slope. The closer P and Q are, the more accurate the slope is.
