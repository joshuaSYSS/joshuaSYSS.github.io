## Derivatives Definitions

### What is a derivative?
The derivative of y = f(x) is the slope of the line tangent to the graph y = f(x).\
But then, what is a tangent line?\
It is the line that is drawn such that it touches the graph (Intersects the graph at 1 point), and the slope of the tangent line is also the slope of the graph at that (intersecting) point.\
\
Imagine you first plot 2 points on the graph, P and Q, where P is the point where you want to evaluate the derivative.\
Now, keep moving Q closer to P, and keep calculating the slope. The closer P and Q are, the more accurate the slope is.

#### Problems:
1. What is the tangent line for y = mx + c?
2. Given y = f(x). f(x) = 5x² - 10. Try to estimate the derivative at x = 5.

### How do we denote a derivative?
You should have learnt that a slope is written as (y₁ - y₂) / (x₁ - x₂).\
Note that both the numerator and denominator means the change in y and x respectively.\
Change of y = Δy\
Change of x = Δx\
Hence, slope = Δy / Δx.\
Since y = f(x), slope = Δy / Δx = Δf / Δx.\
As Δx gets closer to 0 (P and Q get closer to each other), instead of using Δ, we will use the following instead.\
\
**dy / dx** or **y'**\
\
For functions, we will use the following instead.\
\
**f'(x)**\
