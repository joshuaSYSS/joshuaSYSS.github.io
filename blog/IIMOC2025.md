# IIMOC 2025 Blog
The International Invitational Math Optimization Challenge (IIMOC) 2025 is a global math and computer science competition. Each team is assigned an approachable yet unsolvable optimization problem and has four weeks to submit their best solution. The club with the lowest loss wins. Special awards for creativity and best approach are also given.<br>
This year, I invited YAN Yachao to team up and tackle this challenge, and we formed the team [Kui Wong Fan Club](https://iimoc.org/teams.html?team=Kui%20Wong%20Fan%20Club), a team name that mispelled my name. This contest started on November 22nd and ended on December 21st.<br>
