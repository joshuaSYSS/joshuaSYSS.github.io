# 整点正方形计数2
[Link](https://qoj.ac/contest/2534/problem/14547) to the problem.

## Problem Summary
For each point in a given rectangular space, determine the number of squares which is located entirely within the rectangular space, having this point as one of its vertices. Note that the square may not be parallel to the x-axis or y-axis.

## Solution
We iterate through all positive vectors <a, b>, which denotes one of the possible sides of a square. Then, you build a square based on it (the orientation should be unique). Try moving the square within the rectangular space. Notice that there should be four sub-rectangles that can be its vertices. Hence, this is a 2D-difference array problem.
