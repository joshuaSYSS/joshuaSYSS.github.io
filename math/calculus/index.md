## Calculus
Calculus is concerned with two basic operations, differentiation and integration, and is a tool used by engineers to determine such quantities as rates of change and areas [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/calculus).\
This introductory calculus course covers differentiation and integration of functions of one variable, with applications.\
