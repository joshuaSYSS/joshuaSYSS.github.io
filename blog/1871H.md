## Problem Summary
Determine the minimum angle such that the sector from the origin can cover k islands.<br>

## Solution
You can use two pointers to determine the minimum angle. In addition, since it is a cyclic array, you can append the same array to itself. Lastly, you should convert every island into degrees or radians.
